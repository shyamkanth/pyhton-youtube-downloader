As you all know that YouTube doesn't allow its user to download its video to phone storage or PC storage. And there are a number of people who want to save videos of their choice to their storage so that they can watch the video offline whenever they want.
I've created a YouTube video downloader so that you can save the video of your choice to your PC storage. But there is a condition that the video should be downloadable by YouTube, if it is not then the downloader returns an error.
